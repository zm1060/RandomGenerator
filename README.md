# RandomGenerator
Select students to answer questions in class to ensure that everyone is asked in each round.
IT WILL CREATE SOME TXT FILES UNDER THE DIRECTORY.
FOR EXAMPLE,

1_1.txt //MEANS IT IS A CLASS ONE IN 1 CLASS.


1_2.txt //MEANS IT IS A CLASS TWO IN 1 CLASS.

CLASS ONE AND CLASS TWO ARE IN THE SAME CLASSROME

SO THE GENERATOR WILL CHOOSE A CLASS AND THEN CHOOSE A STUDENT FROM THE CLASS.


1.config.txt   TELLS HOW MUCH CLASS IN 1 CLASS.
       
first.txt //Just a flag   whether it is first time to use thie programe
